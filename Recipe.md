Espresso Making Process:-

Splash a small amount of very hot water (around 200Â°F) onto the coffee grounds in the carafe to bloom. Let the coffee bloom for about 30 seconds, then pour in the rest of the hot water. Secure the French press lid onto the cylinder with the plunger all the way up. Allow your espresso to steep for four minutes
